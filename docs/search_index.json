I just started my first semester of my Master’s degree in January 2021 and I do not currently have any data available for use from my project. I hope to use this GPS data from MoveBank (a website for publicly available data) as a surrogate for data I collect in the coming two years. I am unsure of my project yet, but know I will be analyzing ungulate (elk, deer (Odocoileus spp), and livestock) movement through and usage of wildfire-burned areas. The elk data from MoveBank will allow me to look at a similar ungulate species’ movements, as well as prepare me for analyzing my future data; especially if it involves looking at collared wildlife in the state of Utah.

The data was taken from MoveBank and includes basic information. I plan to use the elk ID to ensure points are matched to each individual elk and their corresponding location data. This is captured in latitude/longitude. These points have a timestamp as well as the ambient temperature and elevation captured as the height above the ellipsoid recorded at the time of the location being taken. I also plan to use geospatial data such as: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) elevation historic fire data (if applicable) The geospatial data will help me compare elk movement and location choice to other factors in the environment that may be impacting movement or influencing selection. I chose to keep the data structure simple because I intend to analyze this location data as a stand-in for GPS data I collect or use in my future Master’s research project. 1.2 Description of structure I structured my database very simply (see image below) because of the simplicity of the elk movement dataset. I will make one table within my database that holds all of the chosen data. When I pull in the geospatial data, I can connect the latitude/longitude locations by merging them into a “geom” field in order to run spatial queries. 1.2.1 Database Diagram Figure 1.1: Image of simple database structure (single table) of elk movement I will be using PostgreSQL and PostGIS to work with my converted GPS points and load raster data for futher analysis. I am working on installing these programs onto my computer and getting them set up properly to use with geospatial data! 1.3 Building the Database First, to build the database using RSQLite, I will install the packages necessary for analyzing the data. install.packages(&quot;DBI&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lubridate&quot;) library(DBI) library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) Next, I will need to connect to the created database (already in SQLite). elk_movement_db &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;/Users/Megan/Desktop/Rep_Sci/Elk_Movement_Project/elk_movement.db&quot;) Next, I am able to create queries by using the code below: (However, the table is also already created within my database through SQL) dbExecute(elk_movement_db, &quot;CREATE TABLE elk_gps_data ( elk_id varchar(4) NOT NULL, tag_id varchar(7) NOT NULL, longitude double, latitude double, timestamp double, temp_c float, height_above_ellipsoid_m float, PRIMARY KEY (tag_id) );&quot;) And then I can load data directly from the CSV for use in my table: elk_movement &lt;- read.csv(&quot;/Users/Megan/Desktop/Rep_Sci/Elk_Movement_Project/elk_movement/processed_data/elk_gps_data.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) To see more of my work on GitHub, click here "]]
